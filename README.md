## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women. Ultrasound imaging provides a non-invasive method to detect breast abnormalities. This project focuses on building a **deep learning classifier** for ultrasound images to help in early detection.

**Objectives:**
- Preprocess ultrasound breast images for deep learning.
- Build a CNN-based model for binary classification (Benign vs Malignant).
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
- Provide visualization of model predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **[Dataset Name]**, containing **N images** of ultrasound breast scans.

| Class      | Number of Images | Percentage |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Benign     | XXX            | XX%       |
| Malignant  | XXX            | XX%       |
| Total      | XXX            | 100%      |
